# Admin Dashboard

This project is part of [The Odin Projectâ€™s Intermediate HTML & CSS module](https://www.theodinproject.com/).  

The goal was to create a responsive **Admin Dashboard** layout using **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid**, focusing on practicing layout techniques without relying on frameworks.  


## About the Project
The Admin Dashboard is a static webpage that mimics the structure of a typical admin panel. It includes a **sidebar, header, and main content area** with widgets/cards. The primary aim was to practice **layout composition** rather than building full functionality.  


## Features
- Used **Flexbox** for alignment within components.  
- Used **CSS Grid** for page structure and card layout.  
- Implemented **responsive design** for different screen sizes.  
- Created **reusable components** such as sidebar navigation, header, and dashboard cards.
